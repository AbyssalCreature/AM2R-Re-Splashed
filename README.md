# AM2R-Re-Splashed

This mod is a complete reskin of all the visuals in AM2R.  It aims to make all the Areas, UI elements, Map, Suits, Enemies, and Projectiles to be more stylized and more friendly to users who play in dimly lit areas.
It is also meant to be a base "engine" (not really) for whoever wishes to use it for their own mods, allowing more visual customization, as well including new tracks.
